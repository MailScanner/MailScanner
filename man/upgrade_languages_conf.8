.SH OPTIONS
.sp
\-\-keep\-comments \- tells the script to not update the comments that have changed.
.sp
Using \-\-keep\-comments can cause you to not realize that there are new/more options available to you for the item that your old comment was kept with.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
This manual page briefly documents the upgrade_languages_conf command.
.sp
This manual page was written for the Baruwa project because the
original program does not have a manual page.
.sp
upgrade_languages_conf is helper script for MailScanner, a freely distributable
E\-Mail gateway virus scanner and spam detector. upgrade_languages_conf helps
automate the conversion of older langauge.conf language files to the version of
MailScanner you are installing. This takes care of adding any new config items
that need to be added, removing old deprecated items and updating the comments,
unless you specify \-\-keep\-comments to signal you want your old comments left.
