#
# It's good practice to check through configuration files to make sure
# they fit with your system and your needs, whatever you expect them to
# contain.
#
# Note: If your directories are symlinked (soft-linked) in any way,
#       please put their *real* location in here, not a path that
#       includes any links. You may get some very strange error
#       messages from some of the virus scanners if you don't.
#
# Note for Version 4.00 and above:
#       A lot of the settings can take a ruleset as well as just simple
#       values. These rulesets are files containing rules which are applied
#       to the current message to calculate the value of the configuration
#       option. The rules are checked in the order they appear in the ruleset.
#
# Note for Version 4.03 and above:
#       As well as rulesets, you can now include your own functions in
#       here. Look at the directory containing Config.pm and you will find
#       CustomConfig.pm. In here, you can add your own "value" function and
#       an Initvalue function to set up any global state you need such as
#       database connections. Then for a setting below, you can put:
#               Configuration Option = &ValueFunction
#       where "ValueFunction" is the name of the function you have
#       written in CustomConfig.pm.

# How many MailScanner processes do you want to run at a time?
# There is no point increasing this figure if your MailScanner server
# is happily keeping up with your mail traffic.
# If you are running on a server with more than 1 CPU, or you have a
# high mail load (and/or slow DNS lookups) then you should see better
# performance if you increase this figure.
#
# As a rough guide, try 5 children per CPU.

# queue for new messages? If you have a quiet mail server, you might
# want to increase this value so it causes less load on your server, at

# to be processed.

# 2. A wildcard giving directory names
#    Example: /var/spool/mqueue.in/*
# 3. The name of a file containing a list of directory names,
#    which can in turn contain wildcards.

# They are both provided as I am unsure which one is faster and which

# Still deliver (after cleaning) messages that contained viruses listed

# This can also be the filename of a ruleset.
Still Deliver Silent Viruses = yes

# Should encrypted messages be blocked?

# Options specific to Sophos Anti-Virus
# -------------------------------------
#

# Anything on the next line that appears in brackets at the end of a line

# Removing/Logging dangerous or potentially offensive content
# -----------------------------------------------------------
#

# Do you want to allow partial messages, which only contain a fraction of
# the attachments, not the whole thing? There is absolutely no way to
# scan these "partial messages" properly for viruses, as MailScanner never
# sees all of the attachment at the same time. Enabling this option can
# allow viruses through. You have been warned.
# This can also be the filename of a ruleset so you can, for example, allow
# them in outgoing mail but not in incoming mail.
Allow Partial Messages = no

# Do you want to allow messages whose body is stored somewhere else on the
# internet, which is downloaded separately by the user's email package?
# There is no way to guarantee that the file fetched by the user's email
# package is free from viruses, as MailScanner never sees it.
# This feature is dangerous as it can allow viruses to be fetched from
# other Internet sites by a user's email package. The user would just
# think it was a normal email attachment and would have been scanned by
# MailScanner.
# It is only currently supported by Netscape 6 anyway, and the only people
# who it are the IETF. So I would strongly advise leaving this switched off.
# This can also be the filename of a ruleset.
Allow External Message Bodies = no

# Do you want to allow <IFrame> tags in email messages? This is not a good
# idea as it allows various Microsoft Outlook security vulnerabilities to
# remain unprotected, but if you have a load of mailing lists sending them,

# This can also be the filename of a ruleset, so you can allow them from
# known mailing lists but ban them from everywhere else.
Allow IFrame Tags = no

# Banning <IFrame> tags completely is likely to break some common HTML
# mailing lists, such as Dilbert and other important things like that.
# So before you implement any restriction on them, you can log the sender
# of any message containing an <IFrame>, so that you can set the option
# above to be a ruleset allowing IFrame tags from named "From" addresses
# and banning all others.
# This can also be the filename of a ruleset.
Log IFrame Tags = no

# Do you want to allow <Object Codebase=...> tags in email messages?
# This is bad idea as it leaves you unprotected against various
# Microsoft-specific security vulnerabilities. But if your users demand
# it, you can do it.
# This can also be the filename of a ruleset, so you can allow them just
# for specific users or domains.
Allow Object Codebase Tags = no

# Do you want to convert HTML messages containing <IFrame> or
# <Object Codebase=...> tags into plain text?
# This will only apply if you are also allowing the tags to be present
# using the configuration options above. You can allow messages
# that contain the tags, but convert them to plain text. This makes
# the HTML harmless, while still allowing your users to see the text
# content of the messages.
# This can also be the filename of a ruleset, so you can make this apply
# only to specific users or domains.
Convert Dangerous HTML To Text = no

# Do you want to convert all HTML messages into plain text?

# What to do with spam
# --------------------
#

# This is a list of actions to take when a message is spam.
# It can be any combination of the following:
#    deliver                 - deliver the message as normal
#    delete                  - delete the message
#    store                   - store the message in the quarantine
#    bounce                  - send a rejection message back to the sender
#    forward user@domain.com - forward a copy of the message to user@domain.com
#    striphtml               - convert all in-line HTML content to plain text.
#                              You need to specify "deliver" as well for the
#                              message to reach the original recipient.
#    attachment              - Convert the original message into an attachment
#                              of the message. This means the user has to take
#                              an extra step to open the spam, and stops "web
#                              bugs" very effectively.

#
# Note that the bounce message is created in such a way as to stop it
# bouncing back to your site.
#
# This can also be the filename of a ruleset.

#    forward user@domain.com - forward a copy of the message to user@domain.com
#    striphtml               - convert all in-line HTML content to plain text.
#                              You need to specify "deliver" as well for the
#                              message to reach the original recipient.

#                              of the message. This means the user has to take
#                              an extra step to open the spam, and stops "web

# If you want to use it, read CustomConfig.pm.
Always Looked Up Last = no

# When attempting delivery of outgoing messages, should we do it in the
