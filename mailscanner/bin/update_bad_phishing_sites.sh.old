# Note: Unlike it partner that updates the phishing.safe.sites.conf file,
#       this script does *not* support keeping manual operations, as I need
#       to be able to automatically remove entries from the list as well as
#       add them. Sorry. If you find a site that needs adding to the list,
#       please send it to the spoof@ or abuse@ or postmaster@ address of the
#       domain the site is faking.
