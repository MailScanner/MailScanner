This describes the steps necessary to install MailScanner on SuSE.


Installation

- Ensure that your system has internet access. This is required to 
  install numerous packages via zypper.
   
- Install the MailScanner package, by running the "./install.sh" script
  contained in the distribution directory.

- Install one or more supported antivirus packages. Virtually all Unix
  antivirus packages are supported. The install.sh script will give 
  you the option to install the free Clam AV package during setup.

- You may need to edit the file /etc/MailScanner/virus.scanners.conf
  to set the installation directory you used for your virus scanners.
  You will be able to find this out by running "MailScanner --lint"
  and reading the output to see if all your virus scanners correctly
  spotted the test. MailScanner should automatically find all the
  antivirus packages you have installed.

- Stop any old versions of MailScanner by running

   service MailScanner stop

- Check your configuration by running

    MailScanner --lint

- Stop and disable your original sendmail setup. To do this,

    service sendmail stop
    chkconfig sendmail off
    
    Note that you will need to replace "sendmail" with the MTA you are
    using such as postfix or exim.

- Enable and start your new MailScanner setup.

    chkconfig MailScanner on
    service MailScanner restart
