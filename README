# Welcome to MailScanner!
#
# All the documentation is on-line at:
#
#	Wiki: http://github.com/MailScanner/v4
#	Info: http://www.mailscanner.info
#			
#
# The documentation is kept up to date, and the wiki will help you a lot.
# To install it just run the ./install.sh in the distribution, that will
# do all the hard work for you, and won't ask any difficult questions.
# If you are using sendmail, it will leave you with a system that is ready
# to run, it just requires you change the organisation name. This is set at
# the top of MailScanner.conf which you will probably find in either
# /etc/MailScanner or /opt/MailScanner/etc. Once you are happy with it
# running, start looking at the configuration files in /etc/MailScanner or
# /opt/MailScanner/etc.
#
# If you need help and have read all the documentation and the
# mailscanner.conf file, then join the mailing list and ask there.
# As you have already read the documentation, you know how to do that
# already :-)
