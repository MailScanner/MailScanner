Welcome to MailScanner v4

To install MailScanner, run the "install.sh" script in this directory
with a command

	./install.sh

This installer utilizes the zypper package management system to install
the required system software and Perl modules. Internet connectivity
is required for the installation to execute properly.

Dependency Problems?
--------------------------------------------------------------------

If the MailScanner does not install correctly, you may run the 
installer again and select the NODEPS option. However, this is not
recommended.

If you get really stuck, subscribe to the mailing list (instructions
on the web at www.mailscanner.info) and ask for help, giving a clear
description of what you have done, what sort of system+version you
are running and where you are stuck.

Depending on your issue, you may want to include the output of 

	MailScanner -v
and
	MailScanner --lint
